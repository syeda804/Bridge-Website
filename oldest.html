        <h1>Oldest Bridge in the World</h1>
        <p>The Arkadiko Bridge, located in the Peloponnese region of Greece, is widely regarded as the oldest bridge in the world that is still in use. </p>
        <h2>Here are the details:</h2>
        <P>The Arkadiko Bridge, located in the Peloponnese region of Greece, is the oldest bridge in the world still in use today. Built around 1300 BCE during the Greek Bronze Age, this remarkable structure was part of a road network created by the Mycenaean civilization. Constructed using large limestone blocks and employing the corbel arch technique without mortar, the bridge spans 22 meters (72 feet) in length and stands about 4 meters (13 feet) tall. Originally designed to accommodate chariots traveling between Mycenaean cities, the Arkadiko Bridge remains intact and functional more than 3,000 years later. It is a testament to the advanced engineering skills of the Mycenaeans and the durability of their construction techniques.
