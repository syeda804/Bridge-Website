        <div>
        <p>The Millau Viaduct, located in southern France, holds the title of the tallest bridge in the world, with its highest tower reaching a remarkable height of 343 meters (1,125 feet) above the Tarn River valley. This engineering marvel spans 2,460 meters (1.5 miles) and was completed in 2004. The bridge is part of the A75 autoroute, which facilitates smoother and faster travel across the rugged landscape of the Tarn valley. With its seven soaring piers and sleek, graceful design, the Millau Viaduct is not only the tallest but also one of the most visually striking and iconic bridges globally.
