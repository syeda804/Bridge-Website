        <h1>The Highest Bridge in the World</h1>
        <P>The Duge Bridge in China is officially recognized as the highest bridge in the world, measured by its deck height—the distance from the bridge's roadway to the ground below.</P>
        <h2>Here are the details:</h2>
        <p>The Duge Bridge in China holds the title of the highest bridge in the world, with a staggering deck height of 565 meters (1,854 feet) above the Beipan River Gorge. Completed in 2016, this engineering marvel connects the provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan as part of the G56 Hangzhou–Ruili Expressway. Spanning a length of 1,340 meters (4,396 feet), the bridge significantly reduces travel time in the region while providing breathtaking views of the deep gorge below. The Duge Bridge is a testament to human ingenuity, showcasing advanced construction techniques and the ability to overcome extreme geographical challenges to connect remote regions efficiently.
